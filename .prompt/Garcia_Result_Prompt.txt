Your Intake Review

A comprehensive analysis of your diagnostic data provides a clear picture of your
current health status. As no subjective intake form was provided, this summary is
constructed from the objective clinical findings to infer your health challenges and goals.
● According to the information provided, you are a 41-year-old male with a high-
stress lifestyle who is seeking to improve your energy levels, cardiovascular health,
and hormonal vitality and work towards achieving enhanced longevity, optimized
body composition, and robust immune resilience.
● Your lifestyle currently includes factors that are significantly impacting your health,
as evidenced by markers of systemic inflammation and metabolic distress.
● You report no chronic conditions, however, your diagnostics reveal an emerging
high-risk cardiovascular profile and significant immune dysregulation. Your family
history is not provided but would be a key area for future discussion.
● A positive aspect of your health is the absence of calcified plaque in your coronary
arteries, but this is sharply contrasted by the negative finding of active, non-calcified
plaque, indicating a more immediate form of cardiovascular risk.

● Your current overall health is at a critical inflection point, characterized by a rapid
decline in hormonal function and escalating inflammatory and cardiovascular risks
that require immediate and decisive intervention to alter your health trajectory.

Your Comprehensive Health Overview and Wellness Grade

A comprehensive analysis of your lab results, goals, concerns, medical history, and
lifestyle factors has been performed to generate your current &quot;Wellness Grade&quot;. This
grade is a holistic measure of your health, reflecting not just the absence of disease but
the presence of vitality and resilience.

Current Wellness Grade Explanation/Factors
Considered

Potential Grade if Protocol is
Followed

D+ Your wellness grade reflects a
significant and rapid decline in
key health systems,
particularly endocrine and
cardiovascular function. While
your body shows no signs of
long-term calcified disease, it
is under immense strain from
severe inflammation, hormonal
collapse, and a high-risk lipid
profile. These factors,
combined with evidence of
immune exhaustion, are critical
areas that must be addressed
to improve your vitality and
long-term health.

A-

Potential Explanation: By
fully committing to the
comprehensive
protocol—restoring hormonal
balance, aggressively
managing cardiovascular risk
factors, resolving systemic
inflammation, and adopting the
prescribed lifestyle

changes—you have the
potential to achieve a dramatic
improvement in your health,
reflecting optimized vitality and
significantly reduced disease
risk.

Disclaimer: These scores are
an estimate based on the
provided data and are
informational/motivational only.
It is an estimation of your
potential to improve your
health if you adhere strictly to
the suggested protocol and
lifestyle adjustments.

The assignment of your current grade is not merely a reflection of individual biomarkers
being out of range; rather, it is heavily weighted by the velocity and trajectory of your
health&#39;s decline. The analysis of your diagnostic data from February 2025 compared to
July 2025 reveals an accelerated deterioration in hormonal, metabolic, and immune
function over a span of just five months. This rapid negative trend represents a more
significant and immediate risk than a chronic but stable condition. A patient whose key
health markers are in a state of free fall requires a more urgent and comprehensive
intervention. Therefore, the &quot;D+&quot; grade encapsulates this dynamic risk, making the
potential for improvement to an &quot;A-&quot; a powerful and achievable goal that underscores
the impact of a decisive, targeted wellness strategy.

Analysis of Your Diagnostic Markers

Thank you for entrusting us with your care and for completing your initial evaluation.
This document serves as a summary of your recent diagnostic test results, which we
have carefully analyzed in combination with the detailed information you shared on your
intake form. By integrating the objective data from your lab work with your personal
health history and goals, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of your unique
physiology. The key findings highlighted here will form the scientific foundation for the
personalized treatment protocol we are developing specifically for you, aimed at
restoring your vitality and establishing a trajectory toward long-term health. Below you

will find your diagnostic review with explanations to help you understand your
biochemistry. In this report, diagnostic markers highlighted in red are considered out of
the standard laboratory range. Markers in pink represent the upper end of the normal
reference range, while those in blue indicate the lower end of the normal range. While
these pink and blue markers are not technically abnormal, values at the extreme ends
of a &quot;normal&quot; range may not be optimal for your specific health, goals, and lifestyle, and
can still be associated with your symptoms.

Longitudinal Biomarker Review (February 5, 2025 vs. July 25, 2025)

An analysis of your laboratory results from February 5, 2025 compared to your most
recent results from July 25, 2025 reveals a rapid and concerning deterioration in your
hormonal and metabolic health over a time frame of just over five months. 1 This
longitudinal data is critical, as it shows a clear trajectory of declining endocrine function
and worsening cardiovascular risk markers working against your health goals. This
sharp decline underscores the urgency of the situation and highlights the need for a
decisive intervention to reverse these trends and restore your physiological balance.
The comparative data reveals a cascading endocrine failure. In February, your Follicle-
Stimulating Hormone (FSH) was already below the reference range, indicating that the
pituitary gland&#39;s signal to the testes was faltering. While your testosterone level was still
within the normal range at that time, the suppressed FSH was a critical early warning
sign of impending secondary hypogonadism. This state of compensated dysfunction
has now fully decompensated, as evidenced by the July results showing a near-total
collapse of testosterone production, coupled with a significant elevation in prolactin—a
hormone known to further suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. This
progression was not a sudden event but the predictable outcome of an underlying,
progressive dysfunction driven by chronic stress and inflammation, which was visible
five months prior.

Coronary CTA Imaging (June 28, 2024)
1

Your Coronary CT Angiography provides a direct look at the health of your heart&#39;s
arteries. The results are mixed and highlight the specific nature of your cardiovascular
risk.
● Total Calcium Score: 0. This is an excellent result. It means you have no
calcified, hardened plaque in your coronary arteries. This type of plaque is
associated with long-term, chronic atherosclerosis.
● Stenosis Assessment: CAD-RADS 1 (Minimal Stenosis). This indicates that
there are no significant blockages or narrowing in your heart arteries that would
impede blood flow.
● Plaque Assessment: Minimal Non-Calcified Plaque. This is the most critical
finding of the entire report. While you do not have old, hardened plaque, the scan
identified &quot;very minimal noncalcified plaque&quot; in your Left Anterior Descending
(LAD) artery, often called the &quot;widow-maker.&quot; Non-calcified plaque is soft,
inflammatory, and considered more unstable and prone to rupture than calcified
plaque. This finding, combined with your high Lp-PLA2 level, confirms that you
have active, inflammatory vascular disease that represents a more immediate,

rather than long-term, risk.

Your Top 5 Key Takeaways

1. Critical Cardiovascular Risk: Despite a reassuring calcium score of zero, you
have active, inflammatory, non-calcified plaque in a key heart artery. This,
combined with a high-risk lipid profile (too many small, dense cholesterol particles),
places you at a significant near-term risk for a cardiovascular event that must be
aggressively managed.
2. Severe Hormonal Collapse: Your testosterone has fallen to critically low levels,
driven by dysfunction in your brain&#39;s hormonal signaling centers. This is the primary
cause of your low energy, vitality, and libido and is also a major contributor to your
cardiovascular risk.
3. Systemic Inflammation &amp; Immune Strain: Your body is in a state of high alert,
with significant systemic inflammation and an immune system that is both
exhausted (low T-cell counts) and over-activated (evidence of a chronic viral load
from Epstein-Barr Virus). This chronic battle is draining your resources and fueling
other health issues.
4. Diet-Driven Inflammation: You have a highly significant immune reaction to eggs.
Consuming them is likely a major hidden source of inflammation, contributing to gut
issues and worsening your overall immune and inflammatory status.
5. Chronic Stress Overload: Your stress hormone, cortisol, is elevated, indicating
your body is under constant physiological stress. This is worsening your hormonal
collapse, straining your immune system, and must be addressed through targeted
lifestyle changes and therapies.

Your Personalized 2-Month Protocol

Hormones, Peptides, and Prescription Medications

Welcome to your personalized protocol overview. This document presents a tailored
selection of peptides, hormones, and medications, chosen to align with your specific
goals, intake forms, and diagnostic findings. Each therapy recommendation is
generated through collaboration between advanced artificial intelligence and your
healthcare provider, ensuring a highly individualized, evidence-based approach. Every
suggestion is supported by scientific citations and has been meticulously reviewed
against medical literature and media history for safety and efficacy. Please review your
protocol with your physician to ensure it is appropriate for your ongoing care.

Hormone Optimization &amp; Vitality Protocol

This protocol uses advanced peptides and compounds called secretagogues. Instead of
giving you synthetic hormones, they work by signaling your own body&#39;s pituitary gland to
produce and release more of its natural Growth Hormone (GH). As an adult, GH is your
master repair and rejuvenation hormone, crucial for maintaining lean muscle, managing
body fat, repairing tissues, and supporting overall vitality. 2
● Tesamorelin: This is a GHRH (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone) analog.
Think of it as the &quot;green light&quot; signal that tells your pituitary gland to start producing
and releasing GH. It provides a strong, foundational stimulus for increasing your
overall GH levels.
Your Personalized Protocol Option: Injectable GHRH
● Tesamorelin (3 mg/mL 2x10 mL Vials)
○ What it&#39;s for: A powerful, targeted therapy well-studied for reducing visceral
(deep abdominal) fat and improving overall body composition. This is directly
indicated by your high-risk lipid profile and metabolic markers.
○ Dose: Inject 50 units subcutaneously (SQ) before bed, 5 times per week (e.g.,
Mon-Fri).
○ Duration: The 2-vial supply lasts 8 weeks.
○ Cost: $1300 for the 8-week supply, which works out to $162.50 per week.

Foundational Hormone Optimization Protocol

Think of your body&#39;s hormonal system like a large family tree. At the very top are the
powerful &quot;parent&quot; hormones that the body uses to create many other essential
hormones down the line. This protocol focuses on replenishing these foundational
building blocks, which naturally decline with age and are critically low in your case. 8
● DHEA (The &quot;Mother&quot; Hormone): DHEA is the most abundant circulating hormone
in the body and is the direct parent to your sex hormones, testosterone and
estrogen. Healthy DHEA levels are associated with energy, vitality, a strong
immune system, and resilience to stress.
Your Personalized Program Option: DHEA Revitalization Program
● What It&#39;s For: Restoring overall vitality, energy, stress resilience, and providing the
building blocks for healthy testosterone and estrogen levels. This is essential given
your low DHEA-S, low testosterone, and high cortisol.
● Dosing (Gender Specific): For Men: One (1) 100 mg capsule, taken daily.
● Program Cost: $150 for a 60-day supply.

Nutraceuticals

Welcome to your personalized nutraceutical protocol. This tailored regimen features a
blend of science-backed nutraceuticals, custom-selected to align with your unique
goals, intake forms, and detailed medical history. Whether as a master blend created
exclusively for you or as individualized combinations from preformulated products, each
suggestion is customized to support your personal wellness journey. All
recommendations are rigorously supported by clinical data and scientific citations, and
every component has been meticulously evaluated for safety and efficacy through
thorough review of relevant medical literature and media history. Please consult with
your healthcare provider to ensure that this protocol fits seamlessly with your ongoing
care and specific health needs.

Pre-Formulated Supplements

Dr. Sleep
● What it is: Dr. Sleep is a comprehensive formula designed to help you fall asleep
faster and enjoy a more restful, restorative night. It combines calming minerals,
stress-reducing herbs, and natural sleep-cycle regulators to prepare your mind and
body for deep sleep without causing morning grogginess.
● How the Ingredients Work:
○ Magnesium, Zinc &amp; L-Theanine: This trio works to calm your nervous system,
reduce anxiety, and promote a state of &quot;wakeful relaxation&quot; that helps you
transition easily into sleep.
○ Ashwagandha &amp; Valerian Extract: These traditional herbs are known for their
ability to lower the stress hormone cortisol and enhance the activity of GABA,
your brain&#39;s primary &quot;calming&quot; neurotransmitter. 12
○ Melatonin: A natural hormone that directly signals to your body that it&#39;s time to
sleep, helping to regulate your internal body clock.
● Rationale: Your elevated cortisol level is a major disruptor of healthy sleep
patterns. Improving sleep quality is a foundational step in repairing your HPA
(stress) axis and allowing your hormonal system to recover.
● Administration: Take as directed, 30-60 minutes before bedtime.
● Program Cost: $150 for a 1-month supply.
Dr. NAD
● What it is: Dr. NAD is a formula designed to recharge your cells by boosting your
levels of NAD+, a crucial molecule that declines with age. Think of NAD+ as the
spark plug for your cellular power plants (mitochondria), essential for creating
energy, repairing DNA, and keeping you feeling vital.
● How the Ingredients Work:
○ Nicotinamide Riboside Chloride (NR): A highly effective form of Vitamin B3
that serves as a direct building block for NAD+. 24
○ Resveratrol: A plant-based antioxidant that activates &quot;longevity genes&quot; called
sirtuins, which use the NAD+ you produce to carry out cellular repair.
○ Apigenin: A natural compound that helps protect your NAD+ supply by
blocking an enzyme that breaks it down.
○ Vitamin C (Liposomal): A potent antioxidant that protects your cells and NAD+
molecules from oxidative stress and damage.
● Rationale: Your body is under immense metabolic and inflammatory stress, which

rapidly depletes NAD+ stores. Replenishing NAD+ will support cellular energy
production, combat fatigue, and provide the necessary resources for cellular repair.
● Administration: Take 2 capsules daily in the morning with food.
● Program Cost: $200 for a 2-month supply.

Nutritional IV Therapy

Welcome to your personalized IV therapy protocol. IV therapy is a treatment that
delivers fluids, nutrients, and vitamins directly into your bloodstream, allowing for rapid
and efficient absorption. Your custom IV regimen is designed around your goals, intake
forms, and lab results to precisely support your unique health needs. This approach can
be more effective than oral supplements, as it bypasses the digestive system for
maximum nutrient availability. Each component in your protocol has been rigorously
reviewed for safety and efficacy, and we recommend discussing your plan with your
healthcare provider to ensure it fits your overall care.
Option 1: EBOO - The Ultimate Blood Purification
● What It&#39;s For: The most advanced protocol for systemic detoxification and
revitalization. EBOO is designed to address chronic inflammation, complex chronic
illness, and to provide a comprehensive &quot;reset&quot; for your entire body. 25
● Rationale: Your combination of high inflammatory markers (Ferritin, Lp-PLA2),
evidence of chronic viral load (EBV), and severe dyslipidemia indicates a high level
of systemic toxicity and immune burden. EBOO offers the most powerful
intervention to cleanse the blood, reduce this burden, and create a healthier internal
environment conducive to healing.
● The Process: EBOO (Extracorporeal Blood Oxygenation and Ozonation) is like
dialysis for your blood. It continuously draws blood from one arm, runs it through a
special filtration system where it is cleaned, oxygenated, and ozonated, and then
returns the purified blood to your other arm. Over about an hour, your entire blood
volume is treated.
● Frequency: One session during the 2-month protocol.
● Program Cost: $1,700 per session.
Option 2: High-Dose Vitamin C IV Therapy
● What It&#39;s For: This therapy is primarily used as adjunctive support for the immune
system in cases of chronic or severe illness. 28
● Rationale: Your lab work shows a suppressed immune system (low T-cell counts)
that is simultaneously dealing with a high chronic viral load from Epstein-Barr Virus

(EBV). High-dose Vitamin C provides potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory support,
helping to reduce the burden on your immune system and lower systemic
inflammation.
● The Process: Expect an intravenous infusion lasting 90-180 minutes, administered
in a medical setting with monitoring for vein irritation, blood sugar changes, and
hydration status.
● Frequency: One session per week for the first four weeks of the program.
● Program Cost: $350 per session.

Unique Therapeutic Modalities

Welcome to your personalized treatment protocol, which features a range of advanced
therapies. These diverse modalities can help initiate and support healing processes
throughout your body, targeting underlying imbalances and optimizing overall function.
Based on your intake forms and diagnostic lab tests, the following therapies are tailored
to address issues such as immune dysregulation, chronic viral load, and gut
inflammation. Each therapy is selected not just for its evidence-based benefits, but also
for its ability to work synergistically within a comprehensive wellness approach. We
encourage you to review this protocol with your healthcare provider to ensure the best
fit for your unique health needs and goals.
Thymosin Alpha-1
● Understanding Your Peptide Therapy: Thymosin Alpha-1 is the &quot;immune system
balancer.&quot; It&#39;s naturally produced by your thymus gland and works to modulate your
immune system. It can boost a weak immune response to fight infections or calm
an overactive one to reduce chronic inflammation, creating a better environment for
your body to heal itself. 31
● Rationale: Your diagnostic results show clear evidence of immune dysregulation,
with depleted T-cell counts (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) alongside a high antibody
response to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). This indicates an exhausted immune system
struggling with a chronic pathogen. Thymosin Alpha-1 is specifically indicated to
help restore T-cell function and rebalance the immune response to effectively
manage this chronic viral load.
● Your Personalized Protocol Option: Injectable Vial
○ Thymosin Alpha-1 Vial (3 mg/mL, 5 mL)
○ Dose: Inject 50 units (1.5 mg) subcutaneously (SQ) twice per week.
○ How to take it: Inject into abdominal fat in the morning on your scheduled days
(e.g., Monday and Thursday).

○ Vial Duration: This vial ($450) will last 5 weeks.
BPC-157 (Body Protective Compound)
● Understanding Your Peptide Therapy: Often called the &quot;super-repairman,&quot; this
peptide is derived from a protein found in stomach acid. It&#39;s renowned for its
powerful ability to accelerate the healing of various tissues, including muscles,
tendons, ligaments, and especially the gut lining. It acts locally to reduce
inflammation and promote new blood vessel growth, which is critical for repair. 34
● Rationale: Your highly elevated IgG response to eggs strongly suggests the
presence of increased intestinal permeability, or &quot;leaky gut.&quot; This condition allows
food particles to enter the bloodstream, driving systemic inflammation and immune
activation. BPC-157 is one of the most effective agents for healing the gut lining,
reducing this permeability, and thereby lowering a major source of your body&#39;s
inflammatory burden.
● Your Personalized Protocol Option: Oral Capsules
○ BPC-157 Oral 500 mcg Capsule
○ What it&#39;s for: Best for systemic inflammation and digestive/gut issues.
○ Dose: Take one (500 mcg) capsule daily.
○ How to take it: Take on an empty stomach in the morning, at least 30 minutes
before food.
○ Duration: 60-day supply ($500).

Lifestyle Adjustments

Achieving optimal health is a multifaceted process that extends beyond medical
interventions to encompass meaningful lifestyle changes. This program focuses on
achieving your goals of enhanced longevity, optimized body composition, and robust
immune resilience as well as alleviating the drivers of your cardiovascular risk and
hormonal decline. In this section, you will find evidence-based guidance on key facets of
daily living, including proper hydration, balanced nutrition, stress management,
restorative sleep, and structured exercise modalities. By integrating these individualized
strategies into your daily routine, you can enhance recovery, increase resilience, and
minimize future health risks. Working closely with your care team and embracing these
adjustments empowers you to play an active role in your journey toward enduring health
and wellness.
Lifestyle Snapshot

Your diagnostic profile suggests a state of significant physiological stress, likely driven
by a combination of lifestyle factors, chronic inflammation, and underlying immune
challenges. The elevated cortisol, depleted hormones, and high inflammatory markers
are classic signs of a system that is overwhelmed and struggling to maintain balance.
The following lifestyle adjustments are not merely suggestions but are foundational to
the success of your entire therapeutic protocol; they create the environment in which the
prescribed therapies can work most effectively.
● Water Intake: Proper hydration is critical for detoxification, cellular communication,
and kidney function, especially given your elevated BUN and potassium.
○ Daily Goal: Aim to consume a minimum of 100 ounces of filtered water per
day. Increase this amount on days with intense exercise or high sweat loss.
● Diet/Nutrition: The Anti-Inflammatory Elimination Diet
○ Why this diet was selected: Your lab work reveals two major drivers of
disease that can be directly addressed by nutrition: systemic inflammation (high
Ferritin, high Lp-PLA2) and food-driven immune reactivity (highly elevated IgG
to eggs). The primary goal of this diet is to remove all potential sources of
inflammation, allowing your gut to heal and your immune system to calm down.
This dietary change is the single most powerful lifestyle intervention you can
make to support your protocol.
○ How it works: For the next two months, you will completely eliminate the most
common inflammatory foods. This gives your body a chance to reset. After the
initial period, foods may be carefully reintroduced one at a time to identify any
other sensitivities.
○ How it interacts with your program: By reducing the inflammatory load from
your diet, you allow the therapeutic agents (like BPC-157, Thymosin Alpha-1,
and the anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals) to work more effectively on underlying
issues rather than constantly fighting new fires caused by your food choices.
○ Foods to ELIMINATE for 60 Days:
■ Eggs: All forms (chicken, quail, etc.). This is non-negotiable due to your
high IgG reaction.
■ Gluten: All wheat, barley, rye, and spelt products (bread, pasta, cereals).
■ Dairy: All milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter from cow&#39;s milk.
■ Sugar &amp; Refined Carbohydrates: All added sugars, high-fructose corn
syrup, white bread, white rice, pastries, and sodas.
■ Processed Foods: Anything in a box with a long ingredient list, industrial
seed oils (canola, soy, corn oil), and artificial additives.
■ Alcohol: All forms. Alcohol is a direct toxin to the liver and gut and will
impede your progress.
○ Foods to EMBRACE:

Category Approved Foods

Proteins Grass-fed beef, wild-caught fish (salmon,
sardines), pasture-raised chicken and turkey,
lamb.

Healthy Fats Avocado, extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, nuts
(almonds, walnuts), seeds (chia, flax).

Carbohydrates All non-starchy vegetables (leafy greens,
broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers), sweet
potatoes, quinoa, berries (in moderation).

Snacks A handful of nuts, avocado with sea salt, celery
sticks with almond butter, high-quality protein
powders (pea, beef, or rice-based).
● Exercise: Your exercise regimen is designed to naturally boost testosterone,
improve insulin sensitivity, and strengthen your cardiovascular system.
○ Resistance Training (3 times per week): Focus on compound movements like
squats, deadlifts, overhead presses, and rows. This type of training is a
powerful stimulus for testosterone and growth hormone production.
○ High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) (2 times per week): Perform short
bursts of maximum effort (e.g., 30 seconds of sprinting or stationary bike)
followed by 60-90 seconds of recovery. Repeat for 15-20 minutes. This is highly
effective for improving cardiovascular health and mitochondrial function.
● Stress Reduction: Your high cortisol is a clear sign that your sympathetic (&quot;fight-
or-flight&quot;) nervous system is in overdrive. Actively engaging your parasympathetic
(&quot;rest-and-digest&quot;) system is crucial.
○ Box Breathing: Practice this for 5 minutes, twice daily. Inhale for a count of 4,
hold for 4, exhale for a count of 4, hold for 4. This simple technique has a
profound effect on calming the nervous system.
○ Digital Detox: Excessive use of electronics, especially before bed, bombards
your brain with blue light and stimulating information, disrupting cortisol rhythms
and sleep. Implement a strict &quot;no screens&quot; rule for at least 60 minutes before
your desired bedtime.
● Sleep Hygiene: Sleep is when your body repairs tissue and consolidates hormonal
signaling. It is non-negotiable for recovery.
○ What is Sleep? Sleep is a critical biological process composed of several
stages (light, deep, REM), each with unique restorative functions. Deep sleep is

when physical repair and growth hormone release peak, while REM sleep is
vital for cognitive function and emotional regulation.
○ How to Maximize Quality:
■ Consistent Schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day,
even on weekends.
■ Cool, Dark, Quiet Environment: Your bedroom should be an oasis for
sleep. Use blackout curtains, a sound machine, and set the thermostat to a
cool temperature.
■ Supplement Synergy: Take your Dr. Sleep supplement 30-60 minutes
before bed to signal to your brain and body that it is time to wind down and
prepare for restorative rest.
